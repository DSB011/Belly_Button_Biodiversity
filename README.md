## Objective

The dataset from North Carolina State University's Public Science Lab reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) 
were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.<br>
I ceated an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/results-and-data/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

## Dataset

The [dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/results-and-data/) was taken from North Carolina State University's Public Science Lab. <br>
I refered the article [A Jungle in There: Bacteria in Belly Buttons are Highly Diverse, but Predictable](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0047712) to understand the information and data. 

## Visualizations

Created an interactive visualization dashboard to explore Belly Biodiversity Dataset using various visualization techniques. The interactive visulaization consists
of a drop-down menu, a bar graph and a scatter plot.
